#pre-requesites

1. Install AWS CLI (if not installed)
aws --version
If version shows ‚úÖ, skip to step 2.
If not installed, install it:
brew install awscli

2. Configure AWS CLI with your credentials
   aws configure
   Terraform will automatically pick credentials from here!
   Question | What to Enter
   AWS Access Key ID | Your AWS access key
   AWS Secret Access Key | Your AWS secret key
   Default region name | ap-south-1 (or your region)
   Default output format | json

Install Terraform on Mac (Step-by-Step)
1. Install with Homebrew (easiest way)
   brew tap hashicorp/tap
   brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
2. Verify Terraform Installation
   terraform version
   You should see something like:
   Terraform v1.8.2
   on darwin_amd64

Create s3 bucket - <your-terraform-backend-bucket>
update bucket name in file : aws-ecs-tf-workspace/terraform/backend.tf


Create a DynamoDB Table manually or with Terraform
You have two options:
Option | How
Quickest | Create DynamoDB table manually from AWS Console
Recommended | Use Terraform to create it cleanly


Option 1: Create DynamoDB Table manually (Quickest way)
Go to AWS Console ‚ûî Services ‚ûî DynamoDB

Click "Create table"

Fill like this:

Field | Value
Table name | your-terraform-lock-table
Partition key | LockID (Type: String)
Leave everything else default |
Click "Create table" | 

terraform {
backend "s3" {
bucket         = "your-terraform-backend-bucket"
key            = "ecs-workspace/terraform.tfstate"
region         = "ap-south-1"
encrypt        = true
dynamodb_table = "your-terraform-lock-table"
}
}

Sample First Deploy Flow
cd aws-ecs-tf-workspace/terraform
   terraform init
cd ..
   bash deploy.sh dev

Step 1: terraform init
Output will look like:

Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform.

Step 2: bash deploy.sh dev
Script will:

Create/select dev workspace

Plan the changes

Apply the infrastructure

Terminal output will look like:

Creating workspace "dev"...
Switched to workspace "dev".

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

Refreshing Terraform state...

Terraform will perform the following actions:

# aws_vpc.this will be created
# aws_subnet.public[0] will be created
# aws_subnet.public[1] will be created
# aws_subnet.private[0] will be created
# aws_subnet.private[1] will be created
# aws_ecs_cluster.this will be created
# aws_launch_template.ecs will be created
# aws_autoscaling_group.ecs_asg will be created
# aws_security_group.ecs_instances will be created
# aws_iam_role.ecs_instance_role will be created
# aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.ecs_instance_role_attach will be created

Plan: 10 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
Terraform will perform the actions described above.
Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

Enter a value:
You don't have to type anything because -auto-approve is set in deploy.sh.

Then apply starts:

aws_vpc.this: Creating...
aws_vpc.this: Creation complete after 5s
aws_subnet.public[0]: Creating...
aws_subnet.public[1]: Creating...
...
aws_ecs_cluster.this: Creating...
aws_ecs_cluster.this: Creation complete after 3s
aws_launch_template.ecs: Creating...
aws_launch_template.ecs: Creation complete after 2s
aws_autoscaling_group.ecs_asg: Creating...
aws_autoscaling_group.ecs_asg: Creation complete after 4s
aws_security_group.ecs_instances: Creating...
aws_iam_role.ecs_instance_role: Creating...
aws_iam_role.ecs_instance_role: Creation complete after 2s
aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.ecs_instance_role_attach: Creating...
aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.ecs_instance_role_attach: Creation complete after 1s

Apply complete! Resources: 10 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

ecs_cluster_id = "<ECS_CLUSTER_ID>"
private_subnet_ids = [
"<Private_Subnet_1_ID>",
"<Private_Subnet_2_ID>"
]
vpc_id = "<VPC_ID>"
‚úÖ Deployment successful!

‚úÖ ECS infra is now live inside your AWS account!

üèó What gets created:

Resource | Purpose
VPC | New isolated network
Public + Private Subnets | 2+2 subnets
ECS Cluster | Dev ECS Cluster
EC2 Launch Template | ECS-ready EC2
AutoScaling Group | EC2 instances auto management
Security Group | Allow SSH + HTTP
IAM Roles | Allow EC2 to register to ECS

üéØ That's your first successful deploy experience!
‚úÖ Then, you can go to AWS Console ‚ûî ECS ‚ûî see your dev-ecs-cluster!
‚úÖ Inside EC2 Console ‚ûî see your ECS nodes launched!
